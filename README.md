Q3-   The housing prices in a particular neighborhood are related to the popularity of the land and the size of the house through the following relationship:
homeValue= ( popularity3 + size2  ) * 10000
For example, if the popularity of the neighborhood is 5 and the size of the house is 2, the minimum value for your house should be 1290000 TL.

Write a C program that gets the values of popularity and size from the user and computes &prints the value of homeValue.

A sample run is as follows:
Enter popularity: 5
Enter size: 2
Home value is: 1290000
